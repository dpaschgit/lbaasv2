# Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) Build Document

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive design and build documentation for a Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) API. The API provides CRUD operations for Virtual IPs (VIPs), entitlement verification through ServiceNow CMDB integration, and a standard output format for vendor-specific transformers.

## Key Features

- **VIP Management**: Create, read, update, and delete operations for L4 and L7 VIPs
- **Entitlement Verification**: Integration with ServiceNow CMDB to verify user permissions
- **Multi-vendor Support**: Standard output format for different load balancer vendors
- **Environment Promotion**: Promote VIP configurations between environments
- **IPAM/DNS Integration**: Automated IP allocation and DNS registration
- **Change Management**: All operations require valid ServiceNow change numbers
- **Docker-based Deployment**: Containerized architecture for scalability and portability

## Implementation Guidelines

### Docker Containerization

The LBaaS API should be implemented as a set of Docker containers:

1. **API Container**: FastAPI-based API layer
2. **Business Logic Container**: Core services and business logic
3. **MongoDB Container**: Database for configuration storage
4. **Cache Container**: Redis for caching frequently accessed data
5. **Integration Container**: Connectors for external systems
6. **Mock Services Container**: Mock services for testing

### Development Environment Setup

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Clone the repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the development environment

### API Implementation

1. Implement the API endpoints as defined in the OpenAPI specification
2. Follow the data models and validation rules in the data models document
3. Implement the integration with ServiceNow CMDB and IPAM/DNS systems
4. Implement the transformer service for vendor-specific configurations
5. Implement the environment promotion service

### Testing

1. Use the OpenAPI specification for automated testing
2. Test all endpoints with valid and invalid inputs
3. Test entitlement verification with different user roles
4. Test environment promotion with different scenarios
5. Test integration with mock ServiceNow CMDB and IPAM/DNS systems

## Next Steps

1. **Development Planning**: Create a detailed development plan with milestones
2. **Team Assignment**: Assign team members to specific components
3. **Development**: Implement the API according to the specifications
4. **Testing**: Perform comprehensive testing of all components
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the API to the target environment
6. **Documentation**: Create user and administrator documentation
7. **Training**: Train users and administrators on the API usage
